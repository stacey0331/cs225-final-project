# Team Contract

## Communication

1. **Team Meetings**
We will have weekly meetings on zoom each Thursday, at 7 pm. Each meeting will be 2 hours. 
Since our weekly meetings are before each development log is due, we will put everything discussed in our development log. 

2. **Assistance**
We will use school email or WeChat to contact each other. A WeChat group has already been created. We should expect a response as soon as possible, but we should respond every night or within 24 hours.


3. **Respect**
We will ensure that every member is present for all meetings. If someone can’t make a meeting, we will give him/her a meeting recap.Missing more than 1 weekly meetings is unacceptable except in emergency circumstances (we will let members of our team vote to decide what counts as emergencies). If someone misses more than 1 meetings, that member will have double the amount of his/her original workload. Late for more than 20 minutes is the same as adsent. Lastly, we will make sure all the members have the opportunity to speak by using our WeChat group.


## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution**
We will mainly divide the work by each tool. Yanjie will work on the find shortest path tool with the Dijkstra’s algorithm, Stacey and Jianchen will work on the finding cluster tool with strongly connected component algorithm and BFS. Since the finding cluster tool requires more algorithm and will be more complex, any unforeseen work or unexpected complications will be assigned to Yanjie.


5. **Time Commitment**
Our time commitment will be approximately 2-5 hours per week for each member. When a member has a busier week (like exams or other commitments), we will assign less work to that member that week, and we'll assign more work back to him/her for other weeks. When new commitments inevitably occur, we will let the other member in our smaller work to finish the work, or the member that missed more than 1 meeting.


6. **Conflict Resolution**
When there is a conflict we will let the others in the group decide who is the right one. Any disagreement will be solved by voting and following the majority. If there is a tie and we still can't resolve it, we should contact our mentor. If a member can't finish his/her assigned task, he/she should inform others 24 hours before every team meeting on thursday. If he/she fail to do so more than 2 times, we will inform our mentor.
