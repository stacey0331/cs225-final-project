# Development Log (Date: 11/07/22 -- 11/11/22)

## Weekly Goals
* Complete data correction/cleaning.
* Create airports' latitude and airports' longitude map.
* Create routes adjacency list (use the maps to calculate weights).
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
This week Stacey Lee finished all the data corrections and cleaning. She manually compiled it and make sure the code works as expected. Yanjie Han is working on mapping the latitude and longitude to airports, and Jianchen Hong is working on the Makefile. This week's development log is done by Stacey Lee. 
## Problems Encountered 
Our original plan is to finish the data cleaning, mapping, and making the adjacency list all in this week. However, the data cleaning part is harder than expected, so it took an extra day to finsih. So everything else will be postponed a little, but looks like we can still finish these by next Monday or Tuesday. 
Also, we were having trouble writing the Makefile. Although Stacey Lee wrote test cases for the data cleaning code, but she couldn't run it yet. 
## Plans for next week
Jianchen Hong will finish the Makefile by Monday. Yanjie Han will finish implementing the maps by Tuesday. Stacey Lee will research on adjacency list and be able to implement it quickly after the maps are done. We will do research to have a deep understanding of our algorithms by our next meeting Thursday night (Yanjie Han will do Dijkstra's algorithm, Stacey Lee and Jianchen Hong will do Tarjan's algorithm).
## Optional: Questions for mentor
Can you please give us suggestions on our [data cleaning code](https://github.com/stacey0331/cs225-final-project/blob/master/src/CleanData.cpp)? Thanks in advance.
