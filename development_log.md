# Development Log (Date: 11/03/22 -- 11/04/22)

## Weekly Goals
We have finishd the team contract and the team proposal. 
We have set up rules for how we going to work as a team, and have chosen our dataset and approaches to it.
The task has been seperated into two parts, and each part will be worked on by each two of us.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
This week, Shuyuan Gao has worked on writing the development log. 
We four have all been worked on the team contract and the proposal, and basically set our tone for our project during the first meeting. 
Stacey Lee contributed a lot in writing those two files.

## Problems Encountered 
Yanjie Han(yanjieh2) missed the meeting on Nov 3. I get to call him after to keep him up for that.

## Plans for next week
In the following week, Yanjie Han(yanjieh2) and Shuyuan Gao(sg80) will be working on to find the shortest routes by airport.

Stacey Lee(staceyl2) and Jianchen hong(jh104) will work to find a cluster of places that can be visited in order.

Because next week is filled with some of the mid term exams, we would like to see how far we went on solving our part of the problem.
We will be going on to the website to find sample codes on our algorithm. We will build our data storage. 

The tasks enlisted are the next week plan:
1. Complete data correction/cleaning.
2. Create airports' latitude and airports' longitude map.
3. Create routes adjacency list (use the maps to calculate weights).


## Optional: Questions for mentor
