# Development Log (Date: 11/28/22 -- 12/02/22)

## Weekly Goals
Yanjie: implement the Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.
Stacey and Jianchen: implement Tarjan's Strongly Connected Component Algorithm.
If possible we will try to catch up with our original plan with implementing BFS. 

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Stacey completed the Graph (weighted adjacency list), including all the necessary mappings (map airport id to latitude, longtitude, and name). Stacey also added more details to the data correction file CleanData.cpp, including deleting less used airports, flight routes that are codeshare, and flight routes that contains invalid airports.  
Jianchen Hong is in progress of figuring out how to complete the Makefile. 
Since Yanjie Han has multiple midterms this week, he will start working on his algorithm part (Dijkstra) over this weekend. 

## Problems Encountered 
Even though the graph in Graph.cpp is printing the graph correctly, there's still a bus error to be fixed. We will get that done in two days since the project is due next week. 

## Plans for next week
Since we're behind schedule, all members of our team should put more time than planned on this project next week. 
We should finish all the algorithms by next wednesday (12/7), finish writing test cases no later than friday (12/9), and finish all final deliverables before next sunday (12/11). 
We're still sticking with Yanjie implementing Dijkstra's algorithm, Stacey and Jianchen implementing Tarjan's algorithm and BFS.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
